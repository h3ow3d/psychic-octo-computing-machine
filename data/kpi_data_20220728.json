A bespoke solution was built for all collections to be electronically reported in order to manage this arrangement. The system put in place was totally reliant on manual inputs. Through the lifetime of the contract we did see significant volumes of human error. In the most part this was couriers completing the collection within the window but not reporting it correctly through the app in order to log the activity in relation to the KPI.",

It was agreed by UKHSA that all diverts would be exempt from the SLA measure however from a reporting perspective diverts were still showing as failures.

However, steps are being made on both sides to improve this going forward. Domestic: It took until the last couple of weeks of the FY for invoices to finally start coming through to the marketing inbox, which made the process of receipting more convoluted than it needed to be. There were several issues with invoices being issued incorrectly against the wrong POs (Where we were upweighting) and invoices being sent out ahead of reconciliation with incorrect figures, as well as some invoices taking us over PO value. The domestic team are working closely with OMD to put in place a clear finance process for 22\/23 which will mitigate any errors.",

However, some reports were not as well received, for example reports had errors that had to be flagged around impressions served vs. planned, while the Economist insights were lacking - no sense that OMD had checked to ensure the reporting was of interest. When it comes to PCA (Percentage of Calls Answered) reporting, the international team feel that this is not always proactively done, and we must chase to be able to confirm dates for PCA's. One thing that needs improving is the regional insight on the PCA's for our international network. We are working with OMD on how to best do this. Domestic: All fortnightly digital reports shared ahead of the reporting call. Work is being carried out to make sure reports are received more than half an hour before the call-in future to allow time to review and note down questions, which would make the call a lot more productive.",

Fedcap have since been using their Occupational Inclusion Specialist (OIS) role to drive up increased employment capacity. In some instances hours have been increased, more than one job taken up or higher paid work sought.

The Minister demonstrated his commitment to finalise the Fund Mechanism as soon as possible. The first draft Cash Flow Structure of the Fund was produced and shared with IBN management for comment.\n- Improved Project screening practices: Series 1 Development of the Project Bank was deemed completed at the start of Y6Q4, including the design of Gate 3. The second series is now under development.  \n- Improved Project Development practices: Four projects were taken forward to call for Request For Proposals (RFPs); and an additional Expression of Interest (EOI) was completed (bringing the total to 5 EOIs called in Y6). Terms of Reference (TORs) are in development for an additional five projects.\n- Internal guidelines: During the reporting period, a concept note regarding Design, Build, Finance and Operations Maintenance (DBFOM) was produced. This was presented to the Finance Minister in the workshop on 14th March 2022. The Finance Minister has approved the concept note for further development. The Project Development Unit team will now move forward to develop directives for it\n- Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Following a review of the first SOP draft document in Y6Q3, Y6Q4. OIBN management requested a more simplified check-list type document to be produced. A new legal expert started during Y6Q4 and over the quarter, has reworked a first chapter of the SOP to the required specification.  This has been submitted to OIBN Management for feedback and development of further chapters.  \n- One-Stop Service Centre (OSS) & Project Based Management Information System (PBMIS): In Q4, the OSS and PBMIS digital initiatives completed stage one testing and amendments are in progress.  \n- Social Safeguarding: While \u2018in principle\u2019 approval for the Social Safeguarding TOR had been received from FCDO in Y6Q3, the methodology had not yet been finalised In Y6Q4, following the engagement of a new GESI\/Social Safeguarding Manager in January 2022 and an FCDO field trip to Arun 3, it was agreed to revise the methodology and scope of the approved TOR away from Hydro sector specific guidelines to broad cross-sector guidelines and away from a predominantly study-based exercise (of Arun 3) to a predominantly desk research exercise of a cross-section of sectors. In Y7Q1, APPIIC will re-submit the TOR for FCDO approval and engage a consultant to complete the study. It is anticipated this study will be completed by Y7Q2.",

With the Christmas break and prevalence of Covid during January (causing staff absence) our surgery waiting times increased as a result, however the 3 patients were treated within 9 weeks (so only breached by 1 week). Holidays and Covid outbreaks will always impact our turnaround times so there is little we can do to mitigate delays in the current health climate. It should be noted however that referrals for spinal surgery for the remaining quarter were completed within the 8 week timescale",

This change relates to an amendment to a small element of the pensions requirement which was due to be delivered in February 2022. This initial target implementation date could not be met due to an increase in complexity which was not apparent prior to commencing work, the lack of required resource as a result of challenges in recruitment of staff and the non-availability of existing staff due to COVID. However, whilst work to assess the impact of the required change was completed on target, a revised delivery date of October 2022 has been agreed with the Authority to enable the supplier to overcome the challenges associated with delivery of this particular change, and regular verbal and formal updates are being provided by the supplier. Whilst the challenges inherent with this single change and its delayed implementation means a missed KPI target this quarter, there was no general fall in performance of delivery of all the other changes being delivered under the contract.
