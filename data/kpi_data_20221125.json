We will review these issues in light of the contract renewal (14.05.22) and new shape of the contract now RTS and MTUs no longer feature. We are working on changes to these KPIs with a variation to be agreed in August\/Sept 2022.. The range of KPIs is narrow as befits a delivery and collection contract - we will be reviewing the reported results at the next QBR to understand how these can be improved upon for the balance of the contract to 2023.

This can change significantly on a week to week basis and reflects AY\u2019s instructions from DIO case officers; Time taken for DIO approval process for both obtaining a Purchase Order (PO) and approval of submitting invoices impacts when AY can actually invoice;",

The end user was contacted with a resolution plan but wouldn\u2019t close the complaint until the original task was complete.

In addition, with regards KPI 3, it should be noted that this KPI is measured annually, and performance is expected to recover by end of Q4.
