        "Comments": "There are a number of reasons why STEM Learning appear to be underperforming on SPN:\n1. They are using an untested target profile to establish targets and monitor SPN progress. Having no access to historic SPN engagement data to accurately forecast expected engagement, they agreed to use the same profile as SLPs. This has proved inaccurate but would be in effective to amend the profile at this point in the contract. \n2. They are informed by coaching colleagues who have delivered on SPN during previous years that the summer term historically demonstrates lower engagement due to the pressures of exam period in schools.\n3. Coupled with the onboarding of new partner schools during the autumn term, this indicates the SPN's most intensive period of engagement is from October to April. \n4. All partner schools undertake an action plan based needs analysis with their coach in the autumn term that schedules sustained engagement to meet needs for the full academic year. If we look to the end of the contract (autumn 2023), they are already at 45% of the full year target based on actuals plus future booked CPD. This is increasing daily as more action plans are agreed and dates for CPD are scheduled.",

The target of 85 is the threshold for the number of schools to have completed their action plan at the end of the contract in order not to attract any service points.
