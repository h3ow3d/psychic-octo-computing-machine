This step is necessary in order to make a serious price assessment and to minimise risks for all parties.

With regards KPI 1, CAPITAs ability to achieve recruitment targets during Q1 has been impacted by the ongoing buoyant National jobs market that shows a high vacancy rate, with job postings some 43% above pre-pandemic levels, which means that Capita with the Army offer is competing against many other potential employers to attract recruits to fill these vacancies, whilst at the same time there has been a reduction in the size of the eligible target audience due to changing social demographics. To address these challenges,  Capita is working closely with the Army to drive a number of initiatives seeking to increase overall volumes and further improve conversion rates; these include the recent launch of a new Army website to attract potential candidates, and optimisation of current marketing activities to maximise engagement with main target audiences and generally raise the profile of the Army as an attractive career choice.

This has been highlighted by GMEL at the EDH monthly delivery management meetings and partnership quarterly steering boards and discussed and managed before and during the monitoring of this KPI quarter.  EDH have agreed and approved the need to maintain appropriate programme management and the internally adjusted expectation of a higher percentage of programme management during this period.
