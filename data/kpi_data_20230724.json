With regards KPI 1, CAPITAs ability to achieve recruitment targets during Q4 has been impacted by the ongoing buoyant National jobs market that shows a high vacancy rate, with job postings some 43% above pre-pandemic levels, which means that Capita with the Army offer is competing against many other potential employers to attract recruits to fill these vacancies, whilst at the same time there has been a reduction in the size of the eligible target audience due to changing social demographics. To address these challenges,  Capita is working closely with the Army to drive a number of initiatives seeking to increase overall volumes and further improve conversion rates; these include the recent launch of a new Army website to attract potential candidates, and optimisation of current marketing activities to maximise engagement with main target audiences and generally raise the profile of the Army as an attractive career choice.

The oversight and management of both events mitigated any safety risk due to the collaborative and collegiate approach taken by MOD and Babcock Aerospace. The joint activity was effective in creating an open and effective pathway to resolution, utilising OEM and regulatory information and guidance. The KPI non achievement was not due to poor performance and therefore no remedial activity is required. All parties agreed that the shared approach to this unique situation maintained the highest level of open reporting\/safety management and effective resolution.",
