With regards KPI 1, CAPITAs ability to achieve recruitment targets during Q4 has been impacted by the ongoing buoyant National jobs market that shows a high vacancy rate, with job postings some 43% above pre-pandemic levels, which means that Capita with the Army offer is competing against many other potential employers to attract recruits to fill these vacancies, whilst at the same time there has been a reduction in the size of the eligible target audience due to changing social demographics. To address these challenges,  Capita is working closely with the Army to drive a number of initiatives through RY 23-24 such as the introduction of The Recruitment Bonus Scheme which see soldiers receiving \u00a3500 for every candidate they encourage to start Phase 1 Training which seeks to increase overall volumes and further improve conversion rates; these include the recent launch of a new Army website to attract potential candidates, and optimisation of current marketing activities to maximise engagement with main target audiences and generally raise the profile of the Army as an attractive career choice.
