With regards KPI 1, CAPITAs ability to achieve recruitment targets during Q2 has been impacted by the ongoing buoyant National jobs market that shows a high vacancy rate, with job postings some 43% above pre-pandemic levels, which means that Capita with the Army offer is competing against many other potential employers to attract recruits to fill these vacancies, whilst at the same time there has been a reduction in the size of the eligible target audience due to changing social demographics. To address these challenges,  Capita is working closely with the Army to drive a number of initiatives, such as the introduction of The Recruitment Bonus Scheme which see soldiers receiving \u00a3500 for every candidate they encourage to start Phase 1 Training which seeks to increase overall volumes and further improve conversion rates; these include the recent launch of a new Army website to attract potential candidates, and optimisation of current marketing activities to maximise engagement with main target audiences and generally raise the profile of the Army as an attractive career choice.

With regards KPI 1, CAPITAs ability to achieve recruitment targets during Q2 has been impacted by the ongoing buoyant National jobs market that shows a high vacancy rate, with job postings some 43% above pre-pandemic levels, which means that Capita with the Army offer is competing against many other potential employers to attract recruits to fill these vacancies, whilst at the same time there has been a reduction in the size of the eligible target audience due to changing social demographics. To address these challenges,  Capita is working closely with the Army to drive a number of initiatives, such as the introduction of The Recruitment Bonus Scheme which see soldiers receiving \u00a3500 for every candidate they encourage to start Phase 1 Training which seeks to increase overall volumes and further improve conversion rates; these include the recent launch of a new Army website to attract potential candidates, and optimisation of current marketing activities to maximise engagement with main target audiences and generally raise the profile of the Army as an attractive career choice.

This rating stems from occasions where services did not meet the anticipated standards. Also, there have been unexpected delays in service delivery, affecting the overall service quality and level. Although these challenges were partly beyond XMA's control, implementing a stronger contingency plan could help address such issues and ensure consistent delivery to the specified levels and quality.",

This has been highlighted by GMEL at the EDH monthly delivery management meetings and partnership quarterly steering boards and discussed and managed before and during the monitoring of this KPI quarter.  EDH have agreed and approved the need to maintain appropriate programme management and the internally adjusted expectation of a higher percentage of programme management during this period.

This includes recently introduced attendance and sickness policies, network changes and new seasonal working patterns to improve quality of service. \nWhile acknowledging that the latest quarter results are disappointing, we can assure the Home Office that improving quality of service is the top priority for our business. \nIn the run up to the festive season and our busiest time of year, our main focus has been to take action to address the issues impacting service levels and pull out all the stops to deliver Christmas for our customers.  \n",
