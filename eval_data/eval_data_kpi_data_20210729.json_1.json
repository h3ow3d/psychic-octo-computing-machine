The published figures are our best understanding of the current performance.

This has naturally affected their ability to progress voucher redemption requests \n\u2022 Business process challenges- given that this is a new scheme the supplier did have challenges in putting in place a streamlined process that accurately records the number of days taken to progress voucher redemption requests. For example, when they were sending out requests for more information the supplier did not have a process in place to \u2018stop the clock\u2019 and then \u2018restart the clock\u2019 to allow them to accurately record the time taken to progress voucher redemption requests.\n\u2022 Delays in decision making in relation to next steps- the supplier had a number of vouchers that were not progressed due to delays in decision making and needing a clear steer on direction on more complex vouchers on the scheme.\n\nSince the poor performance was first identified we have been working closely with the supplier to unblock challenges in each area to improve their performance. Their performance in subsequent months has improved to approaching target\/good for Q2 of the financial year. ","Financial Year":"FY20-21","Quarter":"Q4","Months":["Jan","Feb","Mar"]}}

This target is ambitious when compared with the national capital efficiency target of 10% for the 6 year capital FCRM settlement between 2015-2021. The efficiencies targets for this KPI related to the benefits realised from the Full Business case over the 10 year period and as a result the scoring on a quarterly basis is not representative of longer term approach on TEAM2100.\n\nThe Asset Management approach on TEAM2100 there are a number of significant efficiencies through intervention at the right time that cannot be claimed as an efficiency through our current process as they are as a result of Whole Life Cost efficiency and not the capital investment at this stage.\n\nFurthermore, TEAM2100 has recently been through Contract extension negations as part of the contract extension at the end of year 7, through this process we have recalibrated some of our KPIs and modified our incentivisation mechanism. In addition to these changes we have had some challenges in maximising efficiency due to client resource constraints coupled with the in-year capital funding pressures and spanning multiple CSR periods.\n\nWe are currently in Year 7 and the efficiencies achieved to date up to the end of Year 6 (financial year 2020\/21) are approved at \u00a346,721,364 on a total expenditure of \u00a3177,175,446. This indicates we are operating at an efficiency percentage of 20.9% at programme level. ","Financial Year":"FY20-21","Quarter":"Q4","Months":["Jan","Feb","Mar"]}}
