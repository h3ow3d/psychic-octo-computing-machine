As anticipated, this area saw a significant improvement on last quarter, with Voice Response Rate increasing by over 13 percentage points to within 0.01% of target at 89.99%. Previous performance issues were largely out of the control of the Supplier, specifically the National Careers Service transition to a new operating model which resulted in a significant increase in staff attrition (above normal for a contact centre). However, as we moved towards transition completion (at the end of November 2020) we saw significant improvements linked to KPI performance towards the end of the quarter.","Financial Year":"FY20-21","Quarter":"Q3","Months":["Oct","Nov","Dec"]}}
