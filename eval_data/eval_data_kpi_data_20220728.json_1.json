The Minister demonstrated his commitment to finalise the Fund Mechanism as soon as possible. The first draft Cash Flow Structure of the Fund was produced and shared with IBN management for comment.\n- Improved Project screening practices: Series 1 Development of the Project Bank was deemed completed at the start of Y6Q4, including the design of Gate 3. The second series is now under development.  \n- Improved Project Development practices: Four projects were taken forward to call for Request For Proposals (RFPs); and an additional Expression of Interest (EOI) was completed (bringing the total to 5 EOIs called in Y6). Terms of Reference (TORs) are in development for an additional five projects.\n- Internal guidelines: During the reporting period, a concept note regarding Design, Build, Finance and Operations Maintenance (DBFOM) was produced. This was presented to the Finance Minister in the workshop on 14th March 2022. The Finance Minister has approved the concept note for further development. The Project Development Unit team will now move forward to develop directives for it\n- Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Following a review of the first SOP draft document in Y6Q3, Y6Q4. OIBN management requested a more simplified check-list type document to be produced. A new legal expert started during Y6Q4 and over the quarter, has reworked a first chapter of the SOP to the required specification.  This has been submitted to OIBN Management for feedback and development of further chapters.  \n- One-Stop Service Centre (OSS) & Project Based Management Information System (PBMIS): In Q4, the OSS and PBMIS digital initiatives completed stage one testing and amendments are in progress.  \n- Social Safeguarding: While \u2018in principle\u2019 approval for the Social Safeguarding TOR had been received from FCDO in Y6Q3, the methodology had not yet been finalised In Y6Q4, following the engagement of a new GESI\/Social Safeguarding Manager in January 2022 and an FCDO field trip to Arun 3, it was agreed to revise the methodology and scope of the approved TOR away from Hydro sector specific guidelines to broad cross-sector guidelines and away from a predominantly study-based exercise (of Arun 3) to a predominantly desk research exercise of a cross-section of sectors. In Y7Q1, APPIIC will re-submit the TOR for FCDO approval and engage a consultant to complete the study.
