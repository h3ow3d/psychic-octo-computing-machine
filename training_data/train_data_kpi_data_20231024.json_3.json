This has been highlighted by GMEL at the EDH monthly delivery management meetings and partnership quarterly steering boards and discussed and managed before and during the monitoring of this KPI quarter.  EDH have agreed and approved the need to maintain appropriate programme management and the internally adjusted expectation of a higher percentage of programme management during this period.
