This is still a work in progress with some IT glitches and we are investigating a technical issue which we believe is adversely affecting the score.  Expectation among all parties is that this will be improve once resolved.  There are 2 MIs within the Operational Performance KPI that are being reviewed.  The key area of failure within this KPI is reactive tasks and these are being reviewed weekly. The Sustainability KPI failed in Month 3 due to reporting difficulties within the region and this is expected to be resolved in February.  Within the Management KPI there remain some further actions that need to be completed by JLL for them to provide acceptable reports; these are being addressed in January.  The User Experience score has been affected by delivery of reactive services to Staff Residential Properties.  The root cause for this is under investigation.","Financial Year":"FY21-22","Quarter":"Q3","Months":["Oct","Nov","Dec"]}}
