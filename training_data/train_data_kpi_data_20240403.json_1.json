Over the period, high levels of vacancies and sick absence were among the main factors contributing to performance levels.\nRoyal Mail is committed to improving Quality of Service with a clear plan in place, including a quality control centre, recruiting faster than ever before, new sickness, attendance and industry leading health and wellbeing initiatives, including physiotherapy sessions and 24 hour access to GPs, and reinforced operational management and support.\nThe company has also launched a new quality incentive scheme for operational employees during the peak period, worth up to \u00a3500 each for hitting local and national quality targets.\nThe Business Recovery, Transformation and Growth Agreement - which was approved by a ballot of CWU members in July - provides a platform to improve operational performance and reduce absence. This includes recently introduced attendance and sickness policies, network changes and new seasonal working patterns to improve quality of service. \nWhile acknowledging that the latest quarter results are disappointing, we can assure the Home Office that improving quality of service is the top priority for our business. \nIn the run up to the festive season and our busiest time of year, our main focus has been to take action to address the issues impacting service levels and pull out all the stops to deliver Christmas for our customers.  \n","Financial Year":"FY23-24","Quarter":"Q2","Months":["Jul","Aug","Sep"]}}
