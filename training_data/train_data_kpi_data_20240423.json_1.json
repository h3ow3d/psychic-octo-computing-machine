For First Class mail, 70.1% arrived within one working day and 94.4% within three days of posting.\nConsiderable action has been taken to improve quality of service, including new sickness and attendance policies which have played a significant role in reducing sick absence, the launch of a Quality Control Centre and the recruitment of more postmen and women.\nThe third quarter traditionally experiences a lower performance compared to other periods of the year. This is, in part, due to an increase in volume in the network driven by Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Last year this increase was particularly significant as retailers extended their sales. Quality was also affected by high levels of vacancies and sick absence.\nThe most recent performance data from the start of 2024 is much stronger, with a near 10 point improvement in service levels for First Class mail, measured against today\u2019s quality of service data for Q3. This reflects the positive impact of numerous initiatives to improve deliveries.\nThis follows Royal Mail\u2019s best performing Christmas period in four years, with more than 99% of items posted before the last recommended posting dates arriving by Christmas Eve.\n\nAlistair Cochrane, Chief Operating Officer, said: \u201cImproving the reliability of our service is our top priority. We are investing heavily in our network and working hard to deliver the service our customers deserve.\n\u201cWe have seen improvements in quality levels since the end of the Q3 reporting period. However, change will take time and more must be done to transform our 500-year-old business into a modern, sustainable service that accurately reflects the needs of today\u2019s postal users.\n\u201cThis requires structural changes which are already underway but vitally, it requires urgent reform to the Universal Service Obligation which in its current form is not sustainable.\u201d\n","Financial Year":"FY23-24","Quarter":"Q3","Months":["Oct","Nov","Dec"]}}
