To address these challenges,  Capita is working closely with the Army to drive a number of initiatives seeking to increase overall volumes and further improve conversion rates; these include the recent launch of a new Army website to attract potential candidates, and optimisation of current marketing activities to maximise engagement with main target audiences and generally raise the profile of the Army as an attractive job choice","Financial Year":"FY22-23","Quarter":"Q3","Months":["Oct","Nov","Dec"]}}
