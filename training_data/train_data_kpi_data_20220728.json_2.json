When it comes to PCA (Percentage of Calls Answered) reporting, the international team feel that this is not always proactively done, and we must chase to be able to confirm dates for PCA's. One thing that needs improving is the regional insight on the PCA's for our international network. We are working with OMD on how to best do this.

However, steps are being made on both sides to improve this going forward. Domestic: It took until the last couple of weeks of the FY for invoices to finally start coming through to the marketing inbox, which made the process of receipting more convoluted than it needed to be. There were several issues with invoices being issued incorrectly against the wrong POs (Where we were upweighting) and invoices being sent out ahead of reconciliation with incorrect figures, as well as some invoices taking us over PO value. The domestic team are working closely with OMD to put in place a clear finance process for 22\/23 which will mitigate any errors.","Financial Year":"FY21-22","Quarter":"Q4","Months":["Jan","Feb","Mar"]}}
