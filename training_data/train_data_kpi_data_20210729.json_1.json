These works have been impacted by challenges with gaining access to this operational port. The EA normally gains access for works under our statutory powers. However when undertaking works in an operational port we have to secure an agreement with the statutory harbour authority and can only gain entry under a Schedule 22 agreement or legal access agreement. Establishing these agreements have impacted the critical path.\n\nTo try and mitigate the associated impacts, we have established a two tier technical and strategic level working groups between the client partnership and the port authority. This approach is starting to yield successful results and we have been able to undertake extensive ground investigation\/ service searches\/ ground clearance works across the full working footprint in this area. We have also been able to unlock significant enabling works along a 1km section of land controlled by the port authority. We are looking to secure the main construction access agreement within the next 2 months. \n\nAnother significant contributing factor in the impact on the critical path has occurred due to delays with discharging of planning conditions. The Local Planning Authority (LPA) review\/response times have been extended due to COVID related pressures. The project team is in close dialog with the LPA to mitigate this delay as far as is reasonably practicable.\n\nWe are continuously working with our delivery partner to explore construction efficiencies, a good example of this is type of project collaboration, is where we have agreed to remove large obstructions in the ground along the steel sheet pile alignment whilst undertaking the UXO surveys. This will then de-risk the piling process for both UXO and obstructions. We are hoping that by utilising this method it will expedite this construction activity.      \n\nIt should be noted that we are anticipating further planned changes over the next few periods as the risks that were excluded at the tender stage, due to restricted access, are quantified and instructed back into the contract. These are likely to result in a programme adjustment.  \n \nIn conjunction with our delivery partner we have identified a number of substantial value engineering opportunities for this section of the project and we are expecting that this will further help mitigate impacts on this project. \n\nSupplier continues to work with the Authority to review and improve performance.","Financial Year":"FY20-21","Quarter":"Q4","Months":["Jan","Feb","Mar"]}}

There are two elements to the project; replacement of the pumping station and construction of a new outfall. In order to ensure that the new pumping station was delivered on programme the project team delayed the construction of the outfall to follow the delivery of the pumping station rather than as a parallel workstream. The pumping station is on target for delivery this summer, and is operational, thus realising the benefits of the project and better protecting 3,015 homes. The re-programming has meant that the outfall construction now follows the delivery of the pumping station and hence the delay to the completion of the project in it\u2019s entirety. The contractor is working pro-actively and is well resourced to deliver the outfall construction in the shortest possible programme.\n\n","Financial Year":"FY20-21","Quarter":"Q4","Months":["Jan","Feb","Mar"]}}
