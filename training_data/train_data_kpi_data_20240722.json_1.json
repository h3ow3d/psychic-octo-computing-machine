To address these challenges,  Capita is working closely with the Army to drive a number of initiatives through RY 23-24 such as the introduction of The Recruitment Bonus Scheme which see soldiers receiving \u00a3500 for every candidate they encourage to start Phase 1 Training which seeks to increase overall volumes and further improve conversion rates; these include the recent launch of a new Army website to attract potential candidates, and optimisation of current marketing activities to maximise engagement with main target audiences and generally raise the profile of the Army as an attractive career choice.
